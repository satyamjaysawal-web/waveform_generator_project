# Waveform Generator Project

This Python project generates and visualizes waveforms such as sine and square waves. Users can specify the waveform type, frequency, amplitude, phase shift, and other parameters. The generated waveform can be saved as a CSV file or plotted using Matplotlib.

## Requirements

To run the project, you will need to install the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

You can install the dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
